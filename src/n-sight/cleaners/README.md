# Cleaner Scripts

This folder contains cleaner scripts that were extracted from N-Ables support scripts that they reluctantly provide to their customers.
These are locked behind a obfuscated script which validate case numbers and all kinds of shit.

## Update.ps1

I've decoded and extracted the base script and created the `Update.ps1` file which can be used to ensure they are up to date.
The file `Update.ps1` is a script that can be used to fetch the latest versions of these scripts.

Usage:
```powershell
./Update.ps1
```


Feel free to explore and use these cleaner scripts for your needs!
