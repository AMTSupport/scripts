# Registry Automation Scripts

This folder contains scripts that are used to update a Windows registry key. These scripts should be run on a regular basis to ensure that the value of the registry key does not change.

### Creating new scripts

To create new scripts for registry key updates copy the [template script](./template.ps1), rename it and change the values of the parameters to match the registry key you want to modify.
